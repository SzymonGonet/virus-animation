## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

No installation is required. Just clone the repository or download the `app.py` file to your local machine.

### Usage

1. Run the `app.py` script using Python:
   `python app.py`

   This will open a Turtle graphics window and display the pattern.

2. Close the graphics window when you're done.
